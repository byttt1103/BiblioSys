## About BiblioSys

BiblioSys is a web-based book catalog management system aimed to optimize the organization, access and control of bibliographic material in physical libraries. Its purpose is to support staff in the efficient management of loans and book classification, while offering users a modern experience through a digital catalog. BiblioSys arises as a response to the limitations of traditional manual book management methods, seeking to modernize and facilitate the use of library resources for the entire community.
