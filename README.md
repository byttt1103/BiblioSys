## About BiblioSys

BiblioSys is a web-based book catalog management system aimed to optimize the organization, access and control of bibliographic material in physical libraries. Its purpose is to support staff in the efficient management of loans and book classification, while offering users a modern experience through a digital catalog. BiblioSys arises as a response to the limitations of traditional manual book management methods, seeking to modernize and facilitate the use of library resources for the entire community.

This system not only aims to be a practical book catalog management system, but also a web platform where the library can promote itself, expanding the library's audience and promoting its events and services.

This project is being developed in Laravel PHP framework.
